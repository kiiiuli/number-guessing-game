# Number Guessing Game
A simple number guessing game written in Python 3.13.
Iâ€™ll be updating it from time to time as a way to teach myself new things and practice coding.


To play the game:

Make sure you have Python 3.13 installed.

Place all the files (the .py file, images, etc.) in the same folder.

Double-click the .py file to run the game.
